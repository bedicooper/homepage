## Used technologies 

#### `Framework:` This Page was build on React.js framework with custom hooks.

#### `Page Structure:` Routing supported with HashRouter from react-router library.

#### `State Management:` Leveraging Redux-Saga for state management, including middleware for asynchronous operations.

#### `Styling:` Utilizing JSX, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and Styled Components for an appealing and responsive design.

#### `Asynchronous Operations:` Implementing asynchronous functionality using Axios, Async/Await, and Redux-Saga.

#### `Data fetchig:` This website requests data from GitHub API.

#### `UI Inspiration:` This project draws inspiration from UI desing by Ewelina Sklodowska.


### Create React App 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). CRA Provides a streamlined setup for project, including Webpack, Babel, ESLint, PostCSS, CSS Loader & Style Loader

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run deploy`
This script is available for deployment and is responsible for deploying the app to GitHub Pages. Use it to showcase your project to the world!
Remember to change value of `homepage` property in package.json to `"https://YOUR-USER-NAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/"`

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
